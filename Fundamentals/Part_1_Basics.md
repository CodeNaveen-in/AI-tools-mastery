# What is AI?
Artificial Intellligence refers to the technology that aims to replicate the human intelligence within machines and computers. It runs on a set of concepts and tech: 

## Subsets of AI
### Machine Learning
Subset of AI that focuses on building systems that can learn and form decisions based on the data with the help of algorithms with less and less of human intervention with increased time.

### Generative AI 
The type of AI that is meant to produce new content (of any kind code, image, video etc). It creates rather than recognise the content.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
The field of artificial intelligence that allows computers to understand, interpret and interact in a human language similar to human being.

### Expert Systems
Type of AI designed to allow the decision making ability similar to any particular human domain expert.

## How does AI work? 
The procedure of AI working is done by techinqes such as :
1. Data Collection
2. Procesing and Learning
3. Model Training
4. Decision Making
5. Feedback and Improvement

## Types of AI
### Based on ability:
- **Narrow AI** - Type od AI meant to work on one particular set of tasks only. Such as Recommendation system.
- **General AI** - Type of AI that can do tasks with human like intelligence in a variety of domains. 
- **Superintelligent AI**  - Type of AI that is super intelligent that human comprehension and can do lots of taks super efficiently.

### Based on Usage: 
1. Reactive Machines - They do not improve over time as they don't store memory.
2. Limited Memory - They can learn from past experiences and can improve.
3. Theory of Mind - Theoretical AI that can understand human emotions, believes, intentions and other states.
4. Self Aware AI - Theoretical AI that can has self conciousness and take awareness based on self awareness.

## AI Models
Computer programs that learn to do tasks based on recognition of data like humans do.
### Supervised Learning Models
- The type of learning where both input and ouput are known.
- With time model adjsut it's settings (called weights) to minimise difference in predictions.
- It works best with a large and high quality labelled dataset.
- Example : 
  - Reconginsing numbers with handwriting.
### Unsupervised Learning Models
-  The type where input data is without labels or instructions.
-  It does helps in finding unknown patterns.
-  Example : 
   -  Grouping a set of articles by itself.
### Reinforcement Learning Models
- The type of learning with no correct answer just learning.
- AI does learn itself with a set of rewards and penalties.
- Exmaple : 
  - Game Learning

## Benefits of using AI
- High Efficiency
- Improved Decisions
- Personalisation
- 24/7 Avaliability
- Data Analysis

# What is AI Prompt
AI Prompt is a question, command or statement that a person gives to a AI model in order for it to generate an appropriate response.

## AI prompts helps in
- Giving a direct output
- Increased Accuracy
- Saving time applied
- Efficiency in complex tasks
- Improved user experiences

## Types of AI prompts
- Summarisation
- Classification
- Question Answering
- Code creation
- Craetive creation

## Create Better AI prompts
1. Define the task
2. Provide context.
3. Use clear instructions.
4. Consider Audience.
5. Use Open ended questions.

## Problems after AI prompt
- Biased outputs
- Data Privacy
- AI halluciantions
- Model limitations

# What is Prompt Engineering?
- The domain specialising in desinging, refining and optimising AI prompts for effective communication with AI models.
- The goal is to get accurate and relevant outputs from the models for the user.

## Better prompts technique
- Role
- Task
- Instructions
- Context
- Input

## Important Terms
- **Databases** - Informations storage that keeps raw data and factual content fot the model.
- **Workflows** - Iterative and dynamic sequence of data retrevial, prompt creation and AI processing.
- **Prompt Libraries** - Collections of pre-crafted prompt specific guides to the AI models that are helpful in saving time and crafting better responses.
- **Methodologies** - Structured approach to design, test and refine the prompts to give better output.

# How LLM Models Run locally?
1. Install the LM Studio / GPT4all / Ollama
2. Download your chosen LLM
3. launch the model
4. Use it

# AI Guardrails
Safety barriers that are designed to keep AI systems on track and ensure they behave responsibly and safely are called AI guardrails.
It helps in the prevention of :
- Hallucinations
- Data Leakage
- Prompt Injections

## Type of AI guardrails
- **Ethical** - Helps prevent bias and discrimation.
- **Legal** - Ensure compliance with laws and regulations.
- **Technical** - Protect aganist technical faliures and hallucinations.
- **Data Compliance** - Safeguard sensitive information.
- **Brand Alignment** - Ensure outputs are aligned with brand voice.
